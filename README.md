## Step #1

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Solidity-Nirvana/Easy
```


## Step #2

Install [foundry-rs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

**MacOS/Linux**
```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

After running this command, close your terminal and open a new instance, then run the command to install foundry-rs:

```
foundryup
```


**Windows**

If you're on Windows, you will need to install and use [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), as your terminal, 
since Foundryup currently does not support Powershell or Cmd. 

*We recommend installing WSL with Ubuntu-20.04 or Ubuntu-22.04* Then run the command:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

After running this command, close your terminal and open a new instance, then run the command to install foundry-rs:

```
foundryup
```
