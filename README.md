Begin your journey here, the "Easy" difficulty for SolidityNirvana



### Step #1

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Solidity-Nirvana/Easy
```

### Step #2

Install [foundry-rs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

**MacOS/Linux**
```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

**Windows**

If you're on Windows, you will need to install and use [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), as your terminal, 
since Foundryup currently does not support Powershell or Cmd. Then run the command:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

*We recommend installing WSL with Ubuntu-20.04 or Ubuntu-22.04*
