Difficulty:     Easy
Puzzles:        x

Agenda:

Introduction to time units and their usage
 - Explanation of what time units are and their importance in smart contract development
 - Overview of the different types of time units available in Solidity
 
Native time units
 - Explanation of the different native time units available in Solidity, such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks
 - How to use native time units in a contract
 - Best practices for using native time units

Time operations
 - How to perform time operations, such as adding or subtracting time units
 - Best practices for performing time operations

Time conversion
 - How to convert between different time units
 - Best practices for performing time conversions

Hands-on exercise:
 - Users will practice using native time units, time operations and time conversions in smart contracts
 - Users will test the smart contract with different types of time units and observe the different behaviors and implications of them

 JQ - We should also discuss hevm.warp() in this episode and how to test against time units in tests!
