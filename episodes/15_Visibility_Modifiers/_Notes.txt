Difficulty:     Easy
Puzzles:        x

Agenda:

Modifiers are an important aspect of smart contract development, as they allow for reusable code and the implementation of access control. 

Introduction to modifiers and their usage
 - Explanation of what modifiers are, and their importance in smart contract development
 - Overview of the different types of modifiers available in Solidity
 
Defining modifiers
 - How to define modifiers in Solidity
 - Best practices for defining modifiers

Applying modifiers
 - How to apply modifiers to functions and state variables
 - Best practices for applying modifiers

Using multiple modifiers
 - How to use multiple modifiers in a single function or state variable
 - Best practices for using multiple modifiers

Hands-on exercise:
 - Users will practice defining and applying modifiers in smart contracts
 - Users will test the smart contract with different types of modifiers and observe the different behaviors and implications of them
