Title:          Structs
Difficulty:     Easy
Puzzles:        x

Agenda:

Introduction to structs and their usage
 - Explanation of what structs are and how they can be used to define custom data types
 - Overview of the different types of structs available in Solidity
 
Defining a struct
 - How to define a struct in a contract
 - Best practices for defining structs

Using structs
 - How to use structs in a contract
 - Best practices for using structs

Structs and function parameters
 - How to use structs as function parameters
 - Best practices for using structs as function parameters

Structs and function return values
 - How to use structs as function return values
 - Best practices for using structs as function return values

Hands-on exercise:
 - Users will practice defining and using structs in smart contracts
 - Users will test the smart contract with different types of structs and observe the different behaviors and implications of the structs
