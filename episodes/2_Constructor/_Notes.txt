Title:          Constructor
Difficulty:     Easy
Puzzles:        x

Agenda:

The constructor is an important aspect of smart contract development, as it is used to initialize the contract's state and set up any necessary variables.

Introduction to constructors and their usage
 - Explanation of what constructors are and their importance in smart contract development

Defining a constructor
 - How to define a constructor in a contract
 - Best practices for defining constructors

Initializing state variables
 - How to use the constructor to initialize state variables
 - Best practices for initializing state variables

Constructor parameters
 - How to use constructor parameters to set up the contract's state
 - Best practices for using constructor parameters
 
Hands-on exercise:
 - Users will practice defining, initializing and using constructors in smart contracts
 - Users will test the smart contract with constructors and observe the different behaviors and implications of the constructors

JQ - Wow! Using constructors with inheritance seems very interesting, may even be a constructors+ topic?
