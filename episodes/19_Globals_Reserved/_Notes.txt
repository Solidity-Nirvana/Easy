Agenda:

Understanding the use of global variables and reserved keywords is an important aspect of smart contract development, 
as they provide access to important information and functionality.

Introduction to globals and reserved keywords
 - Explanation of what globals and reserved keywords are, and their importance in smart contract development
 - Overview of the different types of global variables and reserved keywords available in Solidity
 
Global variables
 - Explanation of the different types of global variables available in Solidity, such as block.timestamp, msg.sender, and keccak256()
 - How to use global variables in a contract
 - Best practices for using global variables
 
Reserved keywords
 - Explanation of the different reserved keywords in Solidity and their usage
 - Discussion of the consequences of overriding reserved keywords

Hands-on exercise:
 - Users will practice using global variables and reserved keywords in smart contracts
 - Users will test the smart contract with different types of global variables and reserved keywords and observe the different behaviors and implications of them


JQ - Time Units should be its own separate episode, however we will briefly touch on block.timestamp here to reference its identification as a global variable
