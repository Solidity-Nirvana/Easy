Difficulty:     Easy
Puzzles:        x

Agenda:

Operators are an important aspect of programming and understanding how to use them correctly is crucial for writing efficient and error-free code. 

Introduction to operators and their usage
 - Explanation of different types of operators available in Solidity, such as mathematical, logical, and miscellaneous operators
 
Mathematical Operators
 - How to use mathematical operators such as +, -, *, /, %
 - Best practices for using mathematical operators

Logical Operators
 - How to use logical operators such as &&, ||, !
 - Best practices for using logical operators

Bitwise Shift Operators
 - How to use bitwise shift operators such as <<, >>
 - Best practices for using bitwise shift operators

Postfix Increment and Decrement Operators
 - How to use postfix increment and decrement operators such as ++ and --
 - Best practices for using postfix increment and decrement operators

Hands-on exercise:
 - Users will practice using different types of operators to write smart contract functions
 - Users will test the smart contract functions that use different types of operators
