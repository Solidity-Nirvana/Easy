Solidity Nirvana, Episode #18

Title:          EVM Fundamentals
Difficulty:     Easy
Puzzles:        x

Agenda:

Understanding the basics of the blockchain and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is crucial for building effective smart contracts. 

Introduction to blockchain and EVM
 - Explanation of what blockchain and EVM are, and their importance in smart contract development
 - Overview of the key concepts related to blockchain and EVM
 
Gas and Gas Limitations
 - Explanation of what gas is, and how it relates to the cost of executing smart contract operations
 - Discussion of gas limitations and best practices for minimizing gas usage

Blocks
 - Explanation of what blocks are, and how they are used to record and validate transactions on the blockchain
 - Discussion of key concepts related to blocks, such as block hashes, block numbers, and block times

Public Mempool
 - Explanation of what the public mempool is, and how it is used to temporarily store transactions before they are mined
 - Discussion of key concepts related to the public mempool, such as transaction fees and confirmation times

Transactions
 - Explanation of what transactions are, and how they are used to transfer value and execute smart contract operations
 - Discussion of key concepts related to transactions, such as nonces, signatures, and transaction hashes

Public & Private Keys
 - Explanation of what public and private keys are, and how they are used to secure and authenticate transactions
 - Discussion of key concepts related to public and private keys, such as address generation and key management

Hands-on exercise:
 - Users will practice creating and managing transactions, understanding gas and gas limitations, and working with public and private keys
 - Users will test the smart contract with different types of blocks, mempool and keys and observe the different behaviors and implications of them


JQ - We should make a diagram which shows all of these interactions occurring at the same time 
    (like a private key is used with a public key to sign/build a transaction ... this goes into a public mempool ... 
    this goes into a block ... that block has an order / hash / number / block time ... that enacts a state change on the network) !!!


TRANSACTIONS COST GAS
THERES A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH GAS WE CAN USE
THIS PREVENTS US FROM DOING INFINITE WHILE LOOPS
THERE IS RAW ETH FLOATING AROUND ETH ... CALLED "BALANCE"
YOU CAN USE PAYABLE TO RECEIVE AND SEND ETH

FORGE SHOWS US HOW MUCH A TRANSACTION WILL COST
THE GWEI (GAS FEE) DETERMINED BY MARETPLACE DEMAND WILL DETERMINE FINAL FEE
