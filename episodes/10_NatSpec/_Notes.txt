Difficulty:     Easy
Puzzles:        x

Agenda:

NatSpec is an important tool for documenting smart contracts, and it can help to make the code more readable and understandable to others.

Introduction to NatSpec and its benefits
 - Explanation of what NatSpec is and why it's important
 - Overview of the different types of NatSpec documentation that can be provided, including contracts, state variables, and functions

Contract documentation
 - How to use NatSpec to document a contract, including the contract title, author, and description
 - Best practices for contract documentation

State variable documentation
 - How to use NatSpec to document state variables, including the variable name, type, and description
 - Best practices for state variable documentation

Function documentation
 - How to use NatSpec to document functions, including the function name, parameters, and return values
 - Best practices for function documentation

Hands-on exercise:
 - Users will practice creating NatSpec documentation for a smart contract, including contracts, state variables, and functions
 - Users will test the smart contract with NatSpec documentation and observe the different behaviors and implications of the documentation.

JQ - Consider discussing solidity auto-gen documentation packages in python or other similar coding languages.
JQ - Don't forget about event log NatSpec
