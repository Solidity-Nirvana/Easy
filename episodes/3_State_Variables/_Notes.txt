Difficulty:     Easy
Puzzles:        x

Agenda:

State variables are an important aspect of smart contract development, as they store the contract's state and can be used to track important information.

Introduction to state variables and their usage
 - Explanation of what state variables are and their importance in smart contract development

Primitive types
 - Explanation of the primitive types in Solidity such as bool, uint, int, address, bytes32, and string.
 - How to declare and use primitive types in smart contracts
 - Best practices for using primitive types

Arrays
 - Explanation of how to use arrays in Solidity
 - Best practices for using arrays

Hands-on exercise:
 - Users will practice declaring and using different types of state variables in smart contracts
 - Users will test the smart contract with different types of state variables and observe the different behaviors and implications of the state variables
