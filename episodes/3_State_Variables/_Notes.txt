Difficulty:     Easy
Puzzles:        x

Agenda:

Introduction to state variables and their usage
 - Explanation of what state variables are and their importance in smart contract development

Primitive types
 - Explanation of the primitive types in Solidity such as bool, uint, int, address, bytes32, and string.
 - How to declare and use primitive types in smart contracts
 - Best practices for using primitive types

Arrays
 - Explanation of how to use arrays in Solidity
 - Best practices for using arrays

Hands-on exercise:
 - Users will practice declaring and using different types of state variables in smart contracts
 - Users will test the smart contract with different types of state variables and observe the different behaviors and implications of the state variables
