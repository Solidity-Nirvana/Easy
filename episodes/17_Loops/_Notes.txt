Solidity Nirvana, Episode #17

Title:          Loops
Difficulty:     Easy
Puzzles:        x

Agenda:

Loops are an important aspect of programming, and the same applies to smart contract development.

Introduction to loops and their usage
 - Explanation of what loops are and their importance in smart contract development
 - Overview of the different types of loops available in Solidity
 
For loops
 - How to use for loops in a contract
 - Best practices for using for loops

While loops
 - How to use while loops in a contract
 - Best practices for using while loops

Do-while loops
 - How to use do-while loops in a contract
 - Best practices for using do-while loops

Hands-on exercise:
 - Users will practice defining and using loops in smart contracts
 - Users will test the smart contract with different types of loops and observe the different behaviors and implications of them


JQ - Obviously while and do-while loops are super bad, however we should still explain them
