Puzzles:        x

Agenda:

The payable modifier is an important aspect of smart contract development, as it enables contracts to receive Ether and other tokens.

Introduction to payable modifiers and their usage
 - Explanation of what payable modifiers are and their importance in smart contract development
 - Overview of the different types of payable modifiers available in Solidity

Payable state variables
 - How to use the payable modifier with state variables
 - Best practices for using payable state variables

Payable functions
 - How to use the payable modifier with functions
 - Best practices for using payable functions

Fallback (and receive) functions
 - Explanation of what fallback functions are and how they can be used to handle incoming payments
 - How to define and use fallback functions in a contract
 - Best practices for using fallback functions

Hands-on exercise:
 - Users will practice defining and using payable state variables, payable functions and fallback functions in smart contracts
 - Users will test the smart contract with different types of payable modifiers and observe the different behaviors and implications of the payable modifiers
