Solidity Nirvana, Episode #4

Title:          Visibility Modifiers (State Variables)
Difficulty:     Easy
Puzzles:        x

Agenda:

Introduction to visibility modifiers and why they are important
 - Explanation of the different visibility modifiers available in Solidity (public, internal, private)
 - Discuss the implications of choosing different visibility modifiers for state variables

Public visibility modifier
 - How to define a public state variable
 - Examples of when to use a public state variable
 - Best practices for using public state variables

Internal visibility modifier
 - How to define an internal state variable
 - Examples of when to use an internal state variable
 - Best practices for using internal state variables

Private visibility modifier
 - How to define a private state variable
 - Examples of when to use a private state variable
 - Best practices for using private state variables

Hands-on exercise:
 - Users will practice defining state variables with different visibility modifiers
 - Users will test their smart contract and observe the different behaviors and implications of each visibility modifier

 JQ - Do we need to add in the constant modifier and immutable modifier as well here? Or save for another topic. 
      Probably able to fit those into this episode here, although may be useful in another section.
